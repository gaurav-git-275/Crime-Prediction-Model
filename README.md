# Crime-Prediction-Model

This is the first project I developed as I started getting into Data Analytics. This can be considered a prelude to the Final Year project I made in college. 

I am uploading the scripts for two crimes as part of the project, ASSAULT and KIDNAPPING. 

For each of these crimes, I prepared Classification models using Naive Bayes, DT and Logistic Regression. The independent variables used for each of the models include Area, Date, Month to predict whether the specified crime could occur or not. 

According to our observations, Logistic Regression Models gave the best Accuracy, Recall and F1 Score for both crimes.
